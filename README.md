This is the 2020 version of the JRPG prototype I worked on from 2018-2019. After working on the previous version for about a year,
I had to stop due to graduate school work picking up. In 2020, after I graduated, I decided to restart the project with a clean slate,
trying to implement new features in the latest version of GML2 as well as new techniques I learned from tutorials that came out since
I last worked on version 1. 

In this version, I focused more on movement/collision as well as pathfinding and dialogue. Random encounters have been replaced with
enemies on the world map that will chase you once close enough, similar to Chrono Trigger. Dialogue also now has branching
paths and can vary depending on which of the two characters you are playing as.
